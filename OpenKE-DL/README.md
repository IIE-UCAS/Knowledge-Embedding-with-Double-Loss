# OpenKE-PyTorch

An Open-source Framework for Knowledge Embedding implemented with PyTorch.

More information is available on our website

## Overview

OpenKE-PyTorch: the project based on PyTorch, which provides the optimized and stable framework for knowledge graph embedding models.

## Models

OpenKE (PyTorch): 

*	RESCAL
*  DistMult, ComplEx, Analogy
*  TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD
*  SimplE
*	RotatE

We welcome any issues and requests for model implementation and bug fix.

## Experimental Settings

For each test triplet, the head is removed and replaced by each of the entities from the entity set in turn. The scores of those corrupted triplets are first computed by the models and then sorted by the order. Then, we get the rank of the correct entity. This whole procedure is also repeated by removing those tail entities. We report the proportion of those correct entities ranked in the top 10/3/1 (Hits@10, Hits@3, Hits@1). The mean rank (MRR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the test triplets under this setting are also reported.

Because some corrupted triplets may be in the training set and validation set. In this case, those corrupted triplets may be ranked above the test triplet, but this should not be counted as an error because both triplets are true. Hence, we remove those corrupted triplets appearing in the training, validation or test set, which ensures the corrupted triplets are not in the dataset. We report the proportion of those correct entities ranked in the top 10/3/1 (Hits@10 (filter), Hits@3(filter), Hits@1(filter)) under this setting. The mean rank (MRR (filter)) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR (filter)) of the test triplets under this setting are also reported.


## Installation

1. Install PyTorch

2. Clone the KE-DL branch:

	$ git clone https://github.com/IIE-UCAS/Knowledge-Embedding-with-Double-Loss.git
	
	$ cd OpenKE-DL
	
	$ cd openke

3. Compile C++ files
	
	$ bash make.sh
	
4. Quick Start

	$ cd ../
	
	$ cp examples/train_transe_FB15K237.py ./
	
	$ python train_transe_FB15K237.py

## Data

* For training, datasets contain three files:

  train2id.txt: training file, the first line is the number of triples for training. Then the following lines are all in the format ***(e1, e2, rel)*** which indicates there is a relation ***rel*** between ***e1*** and ***e2*** .
  **Note that train2id.txt contains ids from entitiy2id.txt and relation2id.txt instead of the names of the entities and relations. If you use your own datasets, please check the format of your training file. Files in the wrong format may cause segmentation fault.**

  entity2id.txt: all entities and corresponding ids, one per line. The first line is the number of entities.

  relation2id.txt: all relations and corresponding ids, one per line. The first line is the number of relations.

* For testing, datasets contain additional two files (totally five files):

  test2id.txt: testing file, the first line is the number of triples for testing. Then the following lines are all in the format ***(e1, e2, rel)*** .

  valid2id.txt: validating file, the first line is the number of triples for validating. Then the following lines are all in the format ***(e1, e2, rel)*** .

  type_constrain.txt: type constraining file, the first line is the number of relations. Then the following lines are type constraints for each relation. For example, the relation with id 1200 has 4 types of head entities, which are 3123, 1034, 58 and 5733. The relation with id 1200 has 4 types of tail entities, which are 12123, 4388, 11087 and 11088. You can get this file through **n-n.py** in folder benchmarks/FB15K
